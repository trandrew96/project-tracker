This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Steps to get this working:
1. $ npm install (I think)
2. Create a .env file, and create a variable called ATLAS_URI that points to your Mongo Atlas URI
3. Start the backend server. The backend server currently listens on Port 5000 (e.g. localhost:5000)\n$ cd /backend\n$ nodemon server
4. Turn on the react app. The web app that you can visit in the browser is hosted on Port 3000 (e.g. localhost:3000)
   $ cd /project-tracker/
   $ npm start
