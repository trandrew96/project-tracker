This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Steps to get this working:
1. $ npm install
2. Create a .env file, and create a variable called ATLAS_URI that points to your Mongo Atlas URI
3. Start the backend server. It is currently configured to listen localhost:5000<br/>$ cd /backend<br/>$ nodemon server
4. Start the react app. The web app that you visit in the browser is hosted on Port 3000 (e.g. go to localhost:3000 in your browser)<br/>$ cd /project-tracker/<br/>$ npm start
